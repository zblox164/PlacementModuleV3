Welcome to the Official Placement Module V3. The current version is 1.5.2.
This module has been written and developed by zblox164 and is the first iteration
out of three modules to be object oriented. This module does not require credit to use
however it is appreciated since this module has taken many hours to create.

FAQ (based on previous modules as well):
	Q. It is broken. How do I fix this? 
	A. The most likely reason for this, is that you have incorrectly setup the module. 
	You will have to fix your code to fix this 99% of the time. You can also try checking 
	for a newer version of the module. This module version: V1.5.2.
	
	Q. How do I save/load data. 
	A. This module does NOT handle any other tycoon features than the placement system 
	itself. I do have a tutorial series that does include that feature which you can 
	view using this link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJpSI_L8500&list=PLR9RLF7-52bSg0BcGfV2zyvFyFMJwztTt&ab_channel=zblox164
	
	Q. How do I create an inventory system? 
	A. Again, this is NOT included in the module itself. You will have to research this 
	topic and implement this feature on your own.

	Q. How would I add a bloxburg style placement system to your model? 
	A. The module does unfortunately NOT handle this feature. This is merely just a 
	standard placement system where you can move and place objects down. You will have to 
	implement this feature on your own.
