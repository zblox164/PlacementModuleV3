Thank you for using Placement Service!

FAQ:
	Q. Wasn't this used to be named "Placement Module V3"?
	A. Yes! The module was changed from "Placement Module V3" to "Placement Service"
	   since "Placement Module V3" isn't easy remember, and is hard tell what it is without
	   using the module prior.
	
	Q. It is broken. How do I fix this? 
	A. More often than not, this is a user error. Try updating the module or debugging your code.
	   You still can report the issue to me (zblox164), but most likely this is not an internal
	   issue with the module.
	
	Q. How do I save/load placement data. 
	A. This module does NOT handle any other tycoon features other than the placement system 
	   itself. You will have to implement this yourself.
	
	Q. How do I create an inventory system? 
	A. Again, this is NOT included in the module itself. You will have to research this 
	   topic and implement this feature on your own.

	Q. How would I add a bloxburg style placement system to your model? 
	A. The module does unfortunately NOT handle this feature. This is merely just a 
	   standard placement system where you can move and place objects down. You will have to 
	   implement this feature on your own.
	
	Q. Is this module cross platform?
	A. Yes! This module supports XBOX, PC and Mobile devices!
	
	Q. Do I have to credit you for using this module?
	A. You do not have to credit me for the module, however it is appreciated due to the module
	   taking many hours to develop. You cannot claim the system as your own.

If you are interested in learning this module, here are some resources you can use:
 * Look in the API script (sample code is included there)
